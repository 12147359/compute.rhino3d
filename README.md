Compute is built on top of Rhino 7 for Windows and can run anywhere Rhino 7 for Windows can run. The two typical scenarios are:
- Running as a web server on the internet
- Running locally on a user's computer for debugging purposes

Start with the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) to setup your own Compute server, or [compile Compute](docs/installation.md#building-from-source-and-debugging) for local debugging or developing your own features.
